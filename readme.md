Update 25.09.2020: Project moved to Gitlab [here](https://gitlab.com/rnd195/Name-Generator-Excel).

This project is based on numerous random name generators found online. The goal was to create something similar in Excel.

For proper functionality, use the newest version of MS Excel. Make sure to allow macros.

The list of names and stats used can be found on https://names.mongabay.com.
Also, information about each first name leads to https://nameberry.com.

Thank you!
